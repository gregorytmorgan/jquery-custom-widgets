Running Tests
===============================

Within Netbeans
-------------------------------

Using the Project->run->test menu will send a 'run' command to a Karma instance
that will the run Qunit tests based on the karma.conf.js file. This typically will
pop open a browser window which will display the std Qunit test UI. It is possible
to test in multiple browsers at once. Additionally, based on the karma config file,
it is possible to run the tests in headless Chrome and view the results as console
or logfile output.

Note: phantomJS isn't a valid headless browser any longer due
to lack of ES6 support.

There were problems with the Qunit tests being started before a previous test run
had ended. This was fixed in /usr/local/lib/node_modules/karma-qunit/lib/adapter.js by
changing qunitOldTimeout, 13 --> 500.


From Command-line
-------------------------------

Running tests from the command line,

> qunit myTest.js

isn't practical due to getting the necessary libraries loaded.  Use karma instead.

> karma start karma.single-run.conf.js

This approach uses karma config file with singleRun:true.  This config currently
output to the terminal, but it's possible to start a browser instance as well.
